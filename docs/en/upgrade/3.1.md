# 3.1 Upgrade Guide

- Version 3.1 mainly changes the minimum version of `PHP` to `8.1` and the minimum version of `Swoole` to `5.0`.
- Introduced `Pest` testing framework
- Added `hyperf/helper`, migrated `None namespace helper functions` from `Hyperf\Utils` to `hyperf/helper`.
- Change the way `hyperf/config` loads multi-level configuration files to support `. ` syntax, e.g., `config('a.c')`

## Utils package changes

The helper functions in the original utils package did not have namespaces added, and might conflict with functions in other composer packages, so they were removed and replaced in 3.1.

There are two ways to handle this

- If no other packages are introduced into the application, it will cause function conflicts, so you can install `hyperf/helper` directly, and the `helper` package provides helper functions without namespaces, which is the same as the original `utils` package.
- Namespaces are introduced where helper functions are called, and can be refactored using `rector` [refactoring docs here ðŸ”Ž](https://github.com/orgs/hyperf/discussions/5635)

## Configuration file loading changes

In 3.0, configurations existed with `config file name` as the key, whereas in 3.1, `hyperf/config` multi-tier config files are loaded with `relative directory.Config file name` as the key.

Support for `. ` syntax, such as `config('a.c')`.

In this regard, it is important to note that the following two cases are handled in the original project

- 3.0 project has created a subdirectory in `config/autoload`, e.g. `config/autoload/sub/a.php`, the original `config('a')` needs to be changed to `config('sub.a')`.
- Configuration file names in 3.0 projects contain `. `, such as `config/autoload/a.b.php`, will return the following structure when using `config('a')`, and if you also have a `config/autoload/a.php` configuration file, you will also get the result after merging the configuration items.
```php
return [
    'a.php config key' => 'a.php config value',
    'b' => [
        'a.b.php config key' => 'a.b.php config value',
    ]
];
```
